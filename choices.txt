0) github actions: integration with github , can use oidc for auth, clear documentation 
1) use Workload Identity Federation instead of service account keys to access Google Cloud resources with terraform - use direct access
reason: However, service account keys are powerful credentials, and can present a security risk , WIF provide an OIDC token.
Benefits of using OIDC
By updating your workflows to use OIDC tokens, you can adopt the following good security practices:

No cloud secrets: You won't need to duplicate your cloud credentials as long-lived GitHub secrets. Instead, you can configure the OIDC trust on your cloud provider, and then update your workflows to request a short-lived access token from the cloud provider through OIDC.
Authentication and authorization management: You have more granular control over how workflows can use credentials, using your cloud provider's authentication (authN) and authorization (authZ) tools to control access to cloud resources.
Rotating credentials: With OIDC, your cloud provider issues a short-lived access token that is only valid for a single job, and then automatically expires.

we can restrict the pool for only one workflow
